### Disclaimer

This theme is provided as is, and is focused on my personal use of Obsidian on Mac OS. As such it is not thoroughly tested across all operating systems and features of Obsidian. 

This theme modifies significant parts of the Obsidian interface, so it might break with future updates. It may also be incompatible with other bits of custom CSS you have. The theme file is organized in such a way that you can comment out sections that may be causing conflicts.
